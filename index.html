      <h1>Senators</h1>
      <p>
        First convened in 1789, the composition and powers of the Senate are
        established in Article One of the U.S. Constitution. Each state is
        represented by two senators, regardless of population, who serve
        staggered six-year terms. The Senate has several exclusive powers not
        granted to the House, including consenting to treaties as a precondition
        to their ratification and consenting to or confirming appointments of
        Cabinet secretaries, federal judges, other federal executive officials,
        military officers, regulatory officials, ambassadors, and other federal
        uniformed officers, as well as trial of federal officials impeached by
        the House.

        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency.
          In a free society, transparency is government's obligation to share
          information with citizens. It is at the heart of how citizens hold
          their public officials accountable. Here at TGIF we believe that
          government should be transparent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials
          conduct the public business and spend taxpayer money must be readily
          available and easily understood. This transparency allows good and
          just governance. Transparency promotes accountability and provides
          information for citizens about what their Government is doing.
        </p>

        <p>
          We also believe that government should be participatory. Public
          engagement enhances the Government's effectiveness and improves the
          quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in society,
          and public officials benefit from having access to that dispersed
          knowledge. We invite you to use our site to become actively engaged in
          American government.
        </p>

        <p>
          TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can
          readily find and use. We solicit public feedback to identify
          information of greatest use to the public.
